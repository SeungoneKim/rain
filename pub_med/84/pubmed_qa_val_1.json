                    "Although body dysmorphic disorder (BDD) is classified in DSM-III-R as a nonpsychotic somatoform disorder, controversy exists as to whether BDD can present with psychotic features. If it can, this raises the possibility that its DSM-III-R psychotic counterpart-delusional disorder, somatic type--may not be a separate disorder. The purpose of this study was to determine whether patients with nonpsychotic BDD (defined according to DSM-III-R criteria, i.e., with maintenance of some insight) were different from patients with psychotic BDD (those whose preoccupation was without insight and of delusional intensity).",

Family histories of psychiatric disorders were blindly assessed. The 24 patients with nonpsychotic BDD were compared with the 26 patients with psychotic BDD with respect to demographics, phenomenology, course of illness, associated features, comorbid psychiatric disorders, family history, and treatment response.",
                    "Patients with psychotic BDD displayed a significantly higher rate of lifetime DSM-III-R psychotic disorder diagnoses than patients with nonpsychotic BDD. However, the two groups did not differ significantly on most other variables examined. For instance, both psychotic and nonpsychotic patients displayed significant morbidity; high comorbidity with mood, anxiety, and psychoactive substance use disorders; and apparent preferential response to serotonin reuptake inhibitors rather than to non-serotonin reuptake blocking antidepressants or antipsychotics."

One-hundred twenty-eight patients (45.3%) showed a distant relapse, whereas 15 patients (5.3%) developed both distant relapse and local relapse.

Among the asymptomatic patients, the first procedure that led to further examinations was clinical visit alone for 60 (36.4%) of 165 patients, imaging for 103 patients (62.4%), and cytologic examination for 2 patients (1.2%).

In capped payment systems such additional costs have to be offset by other savings if there are no special provisions for extra funding. Our study was designed to determine whether using virtual planning and guided surgery resulted in time saved during surgery and whether this time gain resulted in self-funding of such planning through the time saved.",

Mean differences per RU were compared. Potential variables affecting stone detection rate, including stone size and body mass index (BMI), were evaluated. Interobserver agreement was determined using the intraclass correlation coefficient to measure the consistency of measurements made by the readers.",

The mean difference in stone area was 16.5\u2009mm(2) (-4.6 to 38.5), p\u2009=\u20090.121. The mean size of the largest stone on NCCT and DT was 9.27 and 8.87\u2009mm, respectively.

Surgery was undertaken in 17 patients (85%). The positive predictive value of transesophageal echocardiogram (TEE) for the preoperative diagnosis of the site of infection was 100%. In 13 patients, only the prosthetic valve that seemed infected was replaced. Four of these patients died within a week after the procedure. Nine patients survived the surgical procedure, completed a course of antimicrobial therapy and were followed up for 15.78 months (95% CI: 12.83-18.72).

Two diagnoses were initially considered: seizure or gastroesophageal reflux but this was doubtful. The hypothesis of an equivalent of aquagenic urticaria was then considered; as for patients with this disease, each infant's family contained members suffering from dermographism, maladies or eruption after exposure to water or sun. All six infants had dermographism. We found an increase in blood histamine levels after a trial bath in the two infants tested. The evolution of these \"aquagenic maladies\" was favourable after a few weeks without baths.

The cells from randomly chosen LN were tested by multi-color flow cytometry. Separate portions of LN were snap-frozen and examined for the presence of cytokeratin positive cells (CK). Propensity for apoptosis, level of TCR zeta chain expression of T cells and the number and maturation status of dendritic cells were confronted with the presence of CK-positive cells.",

Using postcode sector data for Scotland (UK), this study tests the hypothesis of spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between area-level deprivation and mortality to determine if contextual differences in the West vs. the rest of Scotland influence this relationship. Research into health inequalities frequently fails to recognise spatial heterogeneity in the deprivation-health relationship, assuming that global relationships apply uniformly across geographical areas. In this study, exploratory spatial data analysis methods are used to assess local patterns in deprivation and mortality. Spatial regression models are then implemented to examine the relationship between deprivation and mortality more formally.",

The main spatial regression result is that deprivation is the only variable that is highly significantly correlated with all-cause mortality in all models. However, in contrast to the expected spatial heterogeneity in the deprivation-mortality relationship, this relation does not vary between regions in any of the models. This result is robust to a number of specifications, including weighting for population size, controlling for spatial autocorrelation and heteroskedasticity, assuming a non-linear relationship between mortality and socio-economic deprivation, separating the dependent variable into male and female SMRs, and distinguishing between West, North and Southeast regions. The rejection of the hypothesis of spatial heterogeneity in the relationship between socio-economic deprivation and mortality complements prior research on the stability of the deprivation-mortality relationship over time."
