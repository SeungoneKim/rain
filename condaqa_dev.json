Volcanoes are often considered to be extinct if there are no written records of its activity. Nevertheless, volcanoes may remain dormant for a long period of time. For example, Yellowstone has a repose/recharge period of around 700,000 years, and Toba of around 380,000 years. Vesuvius was described by Roman writers as having been covered with gardens and vineyards before its eruption of 79 CE, which destroyed the towns of Herculaneum and Pompeii. Before its catastrophic eruption of 1991, Pinatubo was a volcano of significant size, yet it was relatively inconspicuous within the terrain and hence unknown to most people in the surrounding areas. Two other examples are the long-dormant Soufri\u00e8re Hills volcano on the island of Montserrat, thought to be extinct before activity resumed in 1995, and Fourpeaked Mountain in Alaska, which, before its September 2006 eruption, had not erupted since before 8000 BCE and had long been thought to be extinct.",

                "sentence1": "In the American Civil War (1861\u201365), as was typical of the 19th century, more soldiers died of disease than in battle, and even larger numbers were temporarily incapacitated by wounds, disease and accidents. Conditions were poor in the Confederacy, where doctors and medical supplies were in short supply. The war had a dramatic long-term impact on medicine in the U.S., from surgical technique to hospitals to nursing and to research facilities. Weapon development -particularly the appearance of Springfield Model 1861, mass-produced and much more accurate than muskets led to generals underestimating the risks of long range rifle fire; risks exemplified in the death of John Sedgwick and the disastrous Pickett's Charge. The rifles could shatter bone forcing amputation and longer ranges meant casualties were sometimes not quickly found. Evacuation of the wounded from Second Battle of Bull Run took a week. As in earlier wars, casualties sometimes survived unexpectedly due to maggots from the untreated fields debriding the wound -an observation which led to the surgical use of maggots -still a useful method in the absence of effective antibiotics.",

It was first recorded in America in the 1880s and has many variants, some of which are also referred to as \"Hearts\"; especially the games of Black Lady and Black Maria. The game is a member of the Whist group of trick-taking games (which also includes Bridge and Spades), but is unusual among Whist variants in that it is a trick-avoidance game; players avoid winning certain penalty cards in tricks, usually by avoiding winning tricks altogether.

Roosevelt. The morning of the dedication, it was moved forward three hours from 2\u00a0p.m. Pacific time to 11\u00a0a.m.; this was done because Secretary of the Interior Harold L. Ickes had reserved a radio slot for the President for 2\u00a0p.m. but officials did not realize until the day of the ceremony that the slot was for 2\u00a0p.m. Eastern Time. Despite the change in the ceremony time, and temperatures of, 10,000\u00a0people were present for the President's speech, in which he avoided mentioning the name of former President Hoover, who was not invited to the ceremony. To mark the occasion, a three-cent stamp was issued by the United States Post Office Department\u2014bearing the name \"Boulder Dam\", the official name of the dam between 1933 and 1947. After the ceremony, Roosevelt made the first visit by any American president to Las Vegas.",

Usually done without hands, the circular hey may also be done by more than two couples facing alternately and moving in opposite directions - usually to their original places. This name for the figure was invented by Cecil Sharp and does not appear in sources pre-1900. Nonetheless, some early country dances calling for heys have been interpreted in modern times using circular heys. In early dances, where the hey is called a \"double hey\", it works to interpret this as an oval hey, like the modern circular hey but adapted to the straight sides of a longways formation.",

In Moscow, Lenin and Trotsky blamed him for his behavior in the Polish\u2013Soviet war. Stalin felt humiliated and under-appreciated; on 17 August, he demanded demission from the military, which was granted on 1 September. At the 9th Bolshevik Conference in late September, Trotsky accused Stalin of \"strategic mistakes\" in his handling of the war. Trotsky claimed that Stalin sabotaged the campaign by disobeying troop transfer orders. Lenin joined Trotsky in criticising him, and nobody spoke on his behalf at the conference. Stalin felt disgraced and increased his antipathy toward Trotsky. The Polish-Soviet War ended on 18 March 1921, when a peace treaty was signed in Riga.",

The network originally encompassed about of crushed stone carriage roads with 17 stone-faced, steel-reinforced concrete bridges (16 financed by Rockefeller), and two gate lodges\u2014one at Jordan Pond and the other near Northeast Harbor.

Fornication is also sex between two unmarried people, which is also a mortal sin. Aquinas says that \"fornication is a deadly crime\" (pg. 213). Fornication is a mortal sin, but as Aquinas notes, \"Pope Gregory treated sins of the flesh as less grievous than those of the spirit\" (pg. 217). Fornication was a grave sin such as that against property. Fornication, however, is not as grave as a sin directly against God and human life; therefore, murder is much worse than fornication. Property in this case means that a daughter is the property of her father, and if one does wrong to her, one then does wrong to him; therefore seducing a virgin or seeking pleasure from an unmarried woman is an invasion of a father's property.",

Fornication is a mortal sin, but as Aquinas notes, \"Pope Gregory treated sins of the flesh as less grievous than those of the spirit\" (pg. 217). Fornication was a grave sin such as that against property. Fornication, however, is not as grave as a sin directly against God and human life; therefore, murder is much worse than fornication. Property in this case means that a daughter is the property of her father, and if one does wrong to her, one then does wrong to him; therefore seducing a virgin or seeking pleasure from an unmarried woman is an invasion of a father's property.",

To supply sufficient infusoria for fish-rearing in many home aquaria, hobbyists use one of the many commercial cultures available as they are unable to create and maintain their own supply cultures. Infusoria can be cultured by soaking any decomposing matter of organic or vegetative origin, such as papaya skin, in a jar of aged water. The culture starts to proliferate in two to three days, depending on temperature and light received. The water first turns cloudy, but clears up once the infusoria eat the bacteria that caused the cloudiness. At this point, the infusoria are ready, and usually are visible to the naked eye as small, white specks swimming in the container.",
