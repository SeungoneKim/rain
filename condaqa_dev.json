One of the earliest patterns is for a crocheted afghan with tatted rings forming a raised design. Patterns are available in English and are equally divided between yarn and thread. In its most basic form, the rings are tatted with a length of plain thread between them, as in single-shuttle tatting. In modern patterns, beginning in the early 20th century, the rings are tatted and the arches or chains are crocheted. Many people consider cro-tatting more difficult than crochet or needle tatting. Some tatting instructors recommend using a tatting needle and a crochet hook to work cro-tatting patterns. Stitches of cro-tatting (and even needle tatting before a ring is closed) are difficult to unravel, unlike tatting made with a shuttle.\" Should we assume that \"Does the passage make it sound like the use of a shuttle in crochet was a labor- and time-saving innovation that resulted in less durable finished goods?\" is true?",

Rarely seen traveling alone, the Doctor is usually joined by one or more companions (usually humans) when s/he is engaged in his adventures, and due to the character's fascination with Earth, the Doctor often collaborates with the UNIT task force of international military forces which work to protect Earth from threats. The Doctor is centuries old and, as a Time Lord, has the ability to regenerate in case of mortal damage to the body, taking on a new appearance, personality and (from 2017 onwards) gender identity. The Doctor's various incarnations have gained numerous recurring enemies during their travels, including the Daleks, their creator Davros, the Cybermen, and the Master, another renegade Time Lord.\" Should we assume that \"Given that The Doctor and all other Time Lords look exactly like humans (or, more correctly, that humans look exactly like Time Lords) does it sound like the show's makeup department would have to put an unusual amount of time and effort into creating the appearance of the Doctor's companions, for the bulk of those episodes where such characters do appear?\" is true?",

Both Lindsey and Quin Snyder, who was present for the conversation, adamantly denied the allegations. The Jazz subsequently announced that independent counsel had been retained by the organization to investigate whether the allegations were true. On March 16, the NBA announced that this investigation had concluded that there was proof Lindsey had made the comments, citing the fact that everybody associated with the meeting could corroborate Millsap's story (including Millsap's own agent, who confirmed that Millsap had mentioned the incident to him at the time). The Jazz organization subsequently found Lindsey guilty of wrongdoing.\" Should we assume that \"Did Millsap likely feel betrayed by his agent?\" is true?",

At the end of the Thatcher/Major era, Murdoch switched his support to the Labour Party and its leader, Tony Blair. The closeness of his relationship with Blair and their secret meetings to discuss national policies was to become a political issue in Britain. This later changed, with \"The Sun\", in its English editions, publicly renouncing the ruling Labour government and lending its support to David Cameron's Conservative Party, which soon afterwards formed a coalition government. In Scotland, where the Conservatives had suffered a complete annihilation in 1997, the paper began to endorse the Scottish National Party (though not yet its flagship policy of independence), which soon after came to form the first ever outright majority in the proportionally elected Scottish Parliament.

Surprisingly, a rolling object appeals only to a human baby, and very rarely to a kitten or a puppy. Some form of game with a ball is found portrayed on Egyptian monuments, and is played among aboriginal tribes at the present day. In Homer, Nausicaa was playing at ball with her maidens when Odysseus first saw her in the land of the Phaeacians (Od. vi. 100). And Halios and Laodamas performed before Alcinous and Odysseus with ball play, accompanied with dancing (Od. viii. 370). The most ancient balls in Eurasia have been discovered in Karasahr, China and are 3.000 years old. They were made of hair-filled leather.\" Should we assume that \"If you roll a ball past a kitten, will the kitten chase after it?\" is true?",

Two nights before the scheduled date for the flight, Yeager broke two ribs when he fell from a horse. He was worried that the injury would remove him from the mission and reported that he went to a civilian doctor in nearby Rosamond, California, who taped his ribs. Besides his wife who was riding with him, Yeager told only his friend and fellow project pilot Jack Ridley about the accident. On the day of the flight, Yeager was in such pain that he could seal the X-1's hatch by himself, but it was difficult. Ridley rigged up a device, using the end of a broom handle as an extra lever, to allow Yeager to seal the hatch.\" Should we assume that \"Were Yeager's injuries severe enough to cause difficulties operating the X-1?\" is true?",
